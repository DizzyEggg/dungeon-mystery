dungeon-mystery is a Typescript implementation of Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky's dungeon algorithm.

This documentation is designed to give a complete overview of everything made available to you within the npm package.

If you are interested in learning about the specifics of how the dungeon algorithm functions, I encourage you to check the source code, especially [dungeon.ts](https://github.com/EpicYoshiMaster/dungeon-mystery/blob/main/src/dungeon.ts) which provides comments, function address references, and is designed to be readable and understandable for both learning and using the dungeon algorithm. To dive deeper, consider checking out the [Other Resources](Resources.md) section.
